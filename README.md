## Notes:
Since form state is handled with React-Hook-Form; A special devtool is required to directly view form state changes. To enable the devtool, just uncomment this line at the bottom of any component with a form.
```{/* <DevTool control={control} /> */}```

I've also left some comments in the code to explain my thinking in certain situations.
